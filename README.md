# AdventureWorks


**Introduction** 

Adventureorks is a fictious company created by Microsoft, with a comprehensive sample database designed for use with Microsoft SQL server. The database consists of numerous tables related to people, sales, purchasing, products, manufacturing, and inventory. As a practice exercise for SQL, I have decided to analyze AdventureWorks’s database to gain insights in to sales, supply chain, and human resource analysis. My first project will focus on sales analysis, where I aim to increase revenue by 5 % by the end of next year by focusing on the regions that generate the most revenue, increasing marketing efforts, and producing products with the highest profit margin. 


**Problem statement**

The goal of this project is to increase AdventureWorks’s revenue by 5% by the end of next year. This will be achieved by focusing on regions that generate the most revenue, increasing marketing efforts, and producing products with the highest profit margin.

**Data** 

The AdventureWorks sample database, along with a pdf file that explains the database’s relational schemas and all table information, can be obtained from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms. I have upload the resources to my GitHub account for practical purposes.
To gain insights into the problem statement, I will utilize SQL and Power BI to explore and reshape data, use a variety of queries to answer questions, and extract insights.

**Insights**

From May 2011 to June 2014, AdventureWorks generated a total revenue of 10.37 million, with a profit of 13.09 million. Bikes were the most significant contributor to revenue, generating nearly 95 million, while accessories had the most orders, with 19524 orders. Accessories were also the highest profit margin category, with 50%.

The southeast US generated the most revenue, with 24,3 million, while Germany was the lowest revenue-generating region. 

The top 5 revenue-generating products were Mountain-200 Black, 38, Mountain-200 Black, 42, Mountain-200 Silver, 38, Mountain-200 Silver, 42, Mountain-200 Silver, 46.

Top 5 most ordered products were Water Bottle – 30 oz, AWC Logo Cap, Patch Kit/8 Patches, Mountain Tire Tube and Sport-100 Helmet, Blue.

**Recommendations:**

To increase revenue and profit, AdventureWorksshould focus on the southeast US market region. Additionally, Germany’s performance can be improved through effective marketing strategies. Lastly, we should produce more products from accessories to in crease profit.
